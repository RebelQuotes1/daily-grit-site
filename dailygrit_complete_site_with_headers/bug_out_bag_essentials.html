  <h1>🥾 Bug-Out Bag Essentials (No BS Edition)</h1>
  <p>Let’s be real — when it all goes sideways, half the people you know are gonna panic, cry, or livestream their final moments.<br>
  <strong>You?</strong> You’re gonna grab your pack and vanish like a ghost with a grudge.</p>
  <p>This ain’t a Pinterest list. This is gear that saves lives — not wins style points.</p>

  <h2>🔦 1. Tactical Flashlight</h2>
  <p>Ever tried navigating a blackout with a $2 drugstore flashlight? You might as well use a glow stick taped to a twig.</p>
  <p>A <em>real</em> tactical flashlight does more than just shine — it blinds, bashes, and makes you feel like you're starring in a low-budget action movie that actually slaps.</p>
  <a class="button-link" href="https://amzn.to/42rAA3D" target="_blank">Get it here</a>

  <h2>🔥 2. Firestarter Ferro Rod</h2>
  <p>Lighters are for tourists. Matches get soggy. You need something that doesn’t care if it’s soaked, frozen, or dropped in the mud.</p>
  <p>A ferro rod throws sparks like it’s trying to start a war. It doesn’t rely on gas, flame, or luck — just grit and some solid wrist action.</p>
  <a class="button-link" href="https://amzn.to/440NB6N" target="_blank">Light it up</a>

  <h2>🩹 3. First Aid Kit</h2>
  <p>Here’s a fun thought: You get a gnarly cut while scavenging, and your only medical supply is a dirty napkin and good intentions. Yeah. No.</p>
  <p>This first aid kit won’t turn you into a field medic, but it’ll stop the bleeding long enough to finish the mission — or at least make it back to camp without dripping all over the map.</p>
  <a class="button-link" href="https://amzn.to/4cxr2ss" target="_blank">Fix yourself</a>

  <h2>🍖 4. Emergency Ration Pack</h2>
  <p>When your stomach starts growling louder than your dog, you’ll wish you packed more than that one granola bar from 2020.</p>
  <p>These rations ain’t five-star, but they won’t turn into cardboard soup when you’re cold, wet, and pissed off at the sky.</p>
  <a class="button-link" href="https://amzn.to/4j9K36T" target="_blank">Stay fed</a>

  <h2>📻 5. Hand Crank Radio</h2>
  <p>When the power’s out, the towers are down, and panic’s in the air… the only thing left speaking will be your radio.</p>
  <p>This one doesn’t need batteries, sympathy, or Wi-Fi. Just crank it like you’re trying to summon help from the void — because honestly, you might be.</p>
  <a class="button-link" href="https://amzn.to/42LPYJm" target="_blank">Tune in</a>

  <h2>Final Word</h2>
  <p>You can survive with less, sure. But if you’ve ever watched someone try to purify water with TikTok advice, you already know: better prepared beats barely surviving.</p>
  <p>This gear won’t make you a hero. But it might keep you alive long enough to become one.</p>
